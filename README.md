# Rust and WebAssembly Function as a Service (FaaS) on Tencent Cloud

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, follow these simple instructions to [install ssvmup](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/ssvmup/) on your development computer.

## Build the WASM bytecode

We build a [Rust function as a service](src/main.rs). It simply takes the function input from STDIN and outputs the results into STDOUT. That allows it to be used in a variety of different scenarions and payloads. The function anticipates an input JSON string with `key1` and `key2` fields. As we will see that is the JSON format used in TencentCloud's built-in hello world tests.

To build the Rust function into a WebAssembly bytecode application, do the following from your command line. It might take a few minutes to build.

```
$ ssvmup build
```

## Package for deployment

```
$ cp pkg/hello_bg.wasm cloud/
$ cd cloud
$ zip hello.zip *
```

## Deploy on TencentCloud

0 Go to the console https://cloud.tencent.com/?lang=en

1 Go to Products | Serverless Cloud Function | Function Service | Create

2 For Create Method, select CustomRuntime from the dropdown list

3 Select the Empty function template

4 Click on Next

![Deploy step 1](docs/deploy01.png)

5 Set the Execution handler to `hello_bg.wasm`

6 Select "Local zip file" for Submitting Method, and then upload the `hello.zip` file

7 Click on Complete

![Deploy step 2](docs/deploy02.png)

## Test

Once the function is successfully deployed, go to the Function code tab.

![Deploy success](docs/deploy03.png)

Scroll down and click on the Test button. The function will take the hello world JSON data input

```
{
  "key1": "test value 1",
  "key2": "test value 2"
}
```

![Test the function](docs/test.png)

and output a hello message.

```
Hello! test value 1, test value 2
```

![Test execution result](docs/result.png)

That's it! You have now tested and deployed your first server-side WebAssembly function!

## Next step

The next step is to [create a complete demo to run and visualize a machine learning algorithm](https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/tree/master/tencentcloud/ssvm/pca).
